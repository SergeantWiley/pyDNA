# pyDNA
pyDNA is a multirole and multipurpose Library. It's intended to be both an educational and practical uses library. By merging concepts of genetics, epigenetics, data structures, and python code, it assists in multiple fields.

# Education Use
The library contains a educational piece showing concepts of encoding, genes, DNA, decoding, data structures, dictionaries, libraries, mapping, keys, matrixes, and more. It will serve as a starting point for individuals who want to grasp the concept of the advantages of Data with Python

# Practical Use
For anyone who wants to use it for real applications, pyDNA is under acrive development to hopefully contain AnaDNA (Analytics DNA), lanDNA (Language DNA), and mlaDNA (Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence DNA). 

# Analytics DNA
AnaDNA is a module intended to be be able analyse DNA sequences by compressing them into matrixes and give nucleotides numerical vales fod complex operations

# Language DNA
LanDNA will be a module intended to use python as a base for creating a low levrl programming language for DNA events.

#Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence DNA
mlaDNA will be a nodule intended to apply genetic evolution go DNA sequences and monitor how changes in mutations can be used for computer code optimizations and analysis
